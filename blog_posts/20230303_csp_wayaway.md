[WayAway](https://tp.media/click?shmarker=411674&promo_id=5761&source_type=link&type=click&campaign_id=200&trs=210863) is a flight aggregator that allows you to search for the best deals on flights, hotels, car rentals, and more.

To further maximize your savings, here are some additional travel tips:

- Use public transportation: Taking a taxi or renting a car can be expensive. Instead, use public transportation to get around your destination. Many cities offer affordable options like buses, trains, and subways.
- Travel during the off-season: Traveling during peak season can be more expensive due to increased demand. Consider traveling during the off-season when prices may be lower.
- Bring a [reusable water bottle](https://amzn.to/3Yp4m4P): Instead of buying overpriced bottled water at the airport, bring a reusable water bottle and fill it up after going through security. This not only saves you money, but it’s also better for the environment.
Pack your own snacks: Bringing your own snacks can help you save money on food while traveling. Consider packing items like granola bars, trail mix, or fruit to munch on during your trip.
- Remember to always pay your credit card balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest charges. By using [Chase Sapphire Preferred®](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6f/X7LWECUQM0) and [WayAway](https://tp.media/click?shmarker=411674&promo_id=5761&source_type=link&type=click&campaign_id=200&trs=210863), along with these additional travel tips, you can save money on your travel expenses and have more money to spend on experiences and souvenirs.
