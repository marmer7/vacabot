The [Chase Sapphire Preferred® card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6f/X7LWECUQM0) is a premium credit card that offers a generous sign-up bonus and ongoing rewards for dining and travel purchases.

These points can be redeemed for a wide range of travel-related expenses, including flights, hotels, car rentals, and more. The card also offers additional benefits such as trip cancellation/interruption insurance, primary rental car insurance, and baggage delay insurance.

By using the Chase Sapphire Preferred® card to book your travel through WayAway, you can earn even more rewards and save more money.

To further maximize your savings, here are some additional travel tips:

1. Use public transportation: Taking a taxi or renting a car can be expensive. Instead, use public transportation to get around your destination. Many cities offer affordable options like buses, trains, and subways.
2. Travel during the off-season: Traveling during peak season can be more expensive due to increased demand. Consider traveling during the off-season when prices may be lower.
3. Bring a reusable water bottle: Instead of buying overpriced bottled water at the airport, bring a reusable water bottle and fill it up after going through security. This not only saves you money, but it’s also better for the environment.
4. Pack your own snacks: Bringing your own snacks can help you save money on food while traveling. Consider packing items like granola bars, trail mix, or fruit to munch on during your trip.

It’s important to note that you should always pay your credit card balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest charges. By using the [Chase Sapphire Preferred® card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6f/X7LWECUQM0), [WayAway](https://tp.media/click?shmarker=411674&promo_id=5761&source_type=link&type=click&campaign_id=200&trs=210863), and these additional travel tips, you can save money on your travel expenses and have more money to spend on experiences and souvenirs.
